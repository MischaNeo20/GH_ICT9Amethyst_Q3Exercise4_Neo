			<td>LeBron James - LeBron Raymone James Sr. is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association. A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, James was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times while leading Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2003 NBA draft. Additionally, he signed an unprecedented $90 million endorsement contract with the Nike shoe company before he ever played a professional game.</td>

			<td>Lionel Messi - Lionel Messi, (born June 24, 1987, Rosario, Arg.), Argentine-born football (soccer) player. After making his formal debut with FC Barcelona during the 2004–05 season, when he became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the Spanish La Liga, he emerged as one of the game’s dominant players, known for his prolific goal scoring and precise ball control. Messi received an unprecedented four consecutive FIFA world men’s player of the year awards, from 2009 to 2012, and he won the award again in 2015 and 2019. In international competition he helped Argentina win a gold medal at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. He also led the Argentine national team to win the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 World Cup.</td>

			<td>Floyd Mayweather Jr. - Floyd Mayweather, Jr., bynames Money and Pretty Boy, (born February 24, 1977, Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.), American boxer whose combination of speed, power, and technical prowess made him one of the best pound-for-pound fighters of all time. Mayweather earned the nickname “Pretty Boy” during his amateur career because of his unmarked face. He won the national Golden Gloves in 1993, 1994, and 1996 but ended his amateur career on a sour note at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, where he lost a controversial decision to Serafim Todorov of Bulgaria in the semifinals and had to settle for a bronze medal in the featherweight division. He turned pro on October 11, 1996, scoring a second-round knockout of American Roberto Apodaca. Despite a bitter feud between his two trainers—his father, former boxer Floyd Mayweather, Sr., and his uncle Roger Mayweather, a former holder of the World Boxing Council (WBC) super featherweight (junior lightweight) and super lightweight (junior welterweight) titles—Mayweather flourished, winning the WBC junior lightweight title on October 3, 1998, in his 18th bout by stopping veteran American titleholder Genaro Hernandez in the eighth round. Mayweather also won Ring magazine’s Fighter of the Year award in 1998.</td>

			<td>Phil Mickelson - in full Philip Alfred Mickelson, byname Lefty, (born June 16, 1970, San Diego, California, U.S.), American professional golfer who became one of the most dominant players on the Professional Golfers’ Association of America (PGA) Tour in the 1990s and early 2000s. Mickelson is one of 17 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, in which he has finished runner-up a record six times. In 2022, Mickelson became the only golfer who has won 3 (or more) of the 4 majors to join the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour, leaving his longtime PGA Tour membership of 30 years.
Mickelson has spent more than 25 consecutive years in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking. He has spent over 700 weeks in the top 10, has reached a career-high world ranking of No. 2 several times and is a life member of the PGA Tour. Although naturally right-handed, he is known for his left-handed swing, having learned it by mirroring his right-handed father's swing. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2012.
